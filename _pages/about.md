Welcome to my personal blog. 

I recently graduated from ENSEA, a French Engineering School specialized in Electronics. 
I’m currently studying in the first French Big Data’s Post Master Degree, which is dispensed by TELECOM PARISTECH. 

I am looking for a 6 months International INTERNSHIP (North America, Nordic countries, UK).
I am available from July onwards.

My interest in Data Science is growing a little more every day and I would be very happy if I could spread my enthusiasm by scrawling my projects.

You will find here content related to my fields of interest :
- statistics
- machine learning
- deep learning
- big data
- robotic engineering
